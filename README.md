# rime

[IceCube's](https://icecube.wisc.edu) low-level physics processing code,
written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

This is the next generation of IceTray, borrowing heavily from it for
design, but with key differences for multi-core processing.

## Naming

As a "secret" project for IceCube, an icy name is fitting:

> "Rime ice forms when supercooled water liquid droplets freeze onto
> surfaces." [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rime_ice)
